            <h3> Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took. </h3>
            <p>It’s hard for me to think of a major ethical decision I have made that hasn’t been black and white. Supporting your friends, looking out for strangers etc. doesn’t really have the complexity I’m pretty sure this question is looking for. If I think of something better I will come back and edit this, but for now this all I can think of. </p>

        <div id="second-question" class="question-segment">
            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>In truth, ethnic culture hasn’t really affected my upbringing in ways I can identify. I don’t have strong connections to my ethnic culture. However, if we talk about a broader version of the term culture, I do feel like I have been strongly influenced by the people around my age- especially in this day and age where the internet has connected everyone into a sort of shared culture… if that counts.</p>

        <div id="third-question" class="question-segment">
            <h3> Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h3>
            <p>I am good at working in a team, picking up new skills quickly, and communicating with others. I struggle putting myself out there, and having confidence in what I have made.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="forth-question" class="question-segment">
            <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
            <p>I can pick up new skills quickly and that will help tremendously when it comes to actually learning new techniques and the like- but it can lead to me feeling frustrated when I come across things that don’t click with me.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="fifth-question" class="question-segment">
            <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
            <p>In my previous studies there was a particular group project, and during that project most of the team didn’t communicate in an honest way about their contributions to the group.  This led to a significant amount of tension as most members of the group felt that other members weren’t contributing as much as they should.
                <br />
            To counter this, at the beginning of the project we had created a ‘team contract’, which detailed how we should handle conflict- which we all signed and agreed too. We had to sit down and openly talk about how each of us was dealing with this project in an open and honest way- but more importantly- a structured way.
