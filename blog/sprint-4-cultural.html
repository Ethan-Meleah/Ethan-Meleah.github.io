          <h2>Neuroplasticity Research</h2>

          <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people. </h3>
          <p>The first major benefit of understanding neuroplasticity is the knowledge that intelligence isn’t inherent, or fixed. It’s a quality about yourself that can be improved with regular practice, focus, and engagement, which boosts morale/performance when it comes to learning. The second major benefit is that through understanding neuroplasticity is that you are more aware of how your learning benefits you, and how you can better learn.</p>

          <h3>Discuss how might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit.</h3>
          <p>The best way that we can engage with neuroplasticity is to practice constantly. By keeping your brain active, and engaged with whatever you are trying to learn, you keep the neural pathways in your brain active, which lets them ‘grow’ much easier. It’s also a good idea to contextualize the information you are learning. Both understanding why you are learning this information, how this information relates to you and your goals. When you understand why you are learning something, you will be more motivated to learn, and learn more effectively.</p>

          <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity.</h3>
          <p>The simplest and most important way that you can increase your neuroplasticity is by simply getting enough sleep. When your brain has more resources to work with, it can devote more to growth. Another major thing you can do is to reduce stress. Stress causes your neuroplasticity to diminish, so reducing the amount of stress in your life is critical to increasing your neuroplasticity. </p>

         <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

         <h3>Discuss what growth mindset is and why it is relevant.</h3>
         <p>Growth mindset is the belief and mindset that intelligence is not immutable, and can be developed. Growth mindset is important because it creates a passion for learning, rather than a yearning for approval. This is relevant to us here at devacademy because it creates the drive that will allow all of us students to succeed, both here at devacademy and out in the world.</p>

         <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
         <p>Nothing surprised me, but this has prompted me to take the matter of contextualizing my study and finding my passion for everything significantly more seriously. It also has made me reflect and realize for a long time I have had a fixed mindset, and that I am going to have to make a concentrated effort in order to reconfigure my mind into a growth mindset.</p>

         <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
         <p>The two main things I will do to integrate growth mindset into my learning are as follows. The first thing I’ll do is contextualize what I am learning each time, both understanding why I need to learn the specific skills and concepts I am learning, as well as take my time to analyze my thoughts and make sure that I am not falling back into my old, fixed, habits.</p>
