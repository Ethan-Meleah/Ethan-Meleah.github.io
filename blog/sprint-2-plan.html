        <div id="first-question" class="question-segment">
            <h3> What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>Long term I want to become a developer. In truth, I’m not particularly sure what kind of developer I want to be. I’ve had some experience in many different areas of coding and development, more on the software side. I’m here to see if web development is a better option for me and my future. </p>
        </div>
        
        <div id="second-question" class="question-segment">
            <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
            <p>The art of putting myself out there. I can work well in a team and communicate clearly when asked, but putting my own opinions out there or approaching someone can be difficult for me.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="third-question" class="question-segment">
            <h3> What are your own strengths and limitations?</h3>
            <p>I have a good grasp on technical skills, and can pick up new skills and concepts relatively quickly. I’m also good at looking out for other people, both in terms of workload and in general. However, as mentioned above, I am not the best at putting myself out there with people I am unfamiliar with.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="forth-question" class="question-segment">
            <h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
            <p>I will schedule my time out. Give myself a set time to work- typically from 10 to 4. I’ve found that using toggle helps me keep track on if I am on track or not- which is useful for me. I’ve also found that it’s easier for me to keep on track if I’m working with others.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="fifth-question" class="question-segment">
            <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
            <p>In my previous studies, I’ve learned that the best way to balance problem solving vs reaching out for help is to give yourself a time limit. Typically I give myself 45 minutes before reaching out to the faculty, but this might change depending on how big the problem is.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="sixth-question" class="question-segment">
            <h3>What do you expect from the facilitators?</h3>
            <p>I’m happy if they reach back when I reach out. That’s all I really need.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="seventh-question" class="question-segment">
            <H3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in. </H3>
            <p>None of the commitments I have are regular enough- or serious enough- to be a major impact on my studies.</p>
