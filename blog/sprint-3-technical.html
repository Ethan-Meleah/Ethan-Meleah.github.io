        <h3> What is emotional intelligence? </h3>
          <p>Emotional intelligence is defined as the ability of individuals to recognize and understand their own emotions, and the emotions of others around them. It also concerns the ability to adjust and manage one’s own emotions and adapt emotionally to reach your goals.</p>


        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
          <p>I.Q is a measurement designed to ‘measure’ intellect through the use of results on standardized tests. Where E.Q focuses on emotional awareness and management, I.Q is more focused on analytical skills, spatial awareness, and logical reasoning. </p>

        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence is vitally important. Those with high levels of emotional intelligence generally have a more successful life, with traits such as compassion, empathy, and resilience. In regards to work, having a strong level of emotional intelligence allows you to work in a group more effectively, support your team, and withstand the mental and social pressures of a job, and study.</p>

    <h3> What is an analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS. </h3>
      <p>HTML and CSS combined make for a process of construction. Compare it to the construction of a house. HTML is the layout, plumbing, electricity, the general functionality of the house. The HTML is also the layout, declaring which room is what, and the structure of the house. CSS is the stuff that takes the house from being a structure, to a home. Decoration, furniture, and the like.</p>

    <h3> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. </h3>
      <p>Control flow is the order in which the various lines and functions of code are executed. The easiest metaphor to think of is those old goosebumps choose your own path books, ‘go to page four’. A simple example of a control flow would be breakfast.</p>
    <br />
      <p>A loop is a repeating section of code. It will repeat until a defined prerequisite is met. For example, getting dressed can be defined as a loop. You get dressed by putting on a piece of clothing until you are fully dressed. This is a simple loop, something along the lines of:</p>

      <span class="pseudocode"><p>While not fully dressed, <br />
        Equip one Clothing, <br />
        When Total Clothing = 5, <br />
        Dressed = Fully</p></span>

        <p>The above is pseudocode, not real. </p>

    <h3> Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </h3>
      <p>DOM, or ‘Document Object Model’, is the first step in rendering a web-page. That is, it’s the first step in turning the web-page from the written HTML and CSS, to a web-page that you see on the screen. Javascript is used to specifically target individual objects and manipulate them in various ways. For example, it could be used (through javascript) to change the text of a button after you click it.</p>

    <h3> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </h3>
      <p>Data is stored within objects and arrays differently. Objects use data to describe the properties of the object, for example a lego block could have the size and color properties. These general properties are the same for each instance of this object, so every lego block has a size and color. You access the data from these objects by calling these properties by name.
        <br />
      Arrays are more like a library, in the real life building sense. They are a collection of items connected to an ‘index’. Comparatively, this would be each book having their own number in the dewey decimal system. You would be able to access the information within by calling on its index, and can sort them in similar ways.</p>

    <h3> Explain what functions are and why they are useful. </h3>
      <p>Functions are chunks of code that are activated when another piece of code asks for them. Functions are one of the most important concepts behind the majority of programming languages. They allow for specific actions to be taken only when they need to be taken, instead of immediately firing when the page is loaded. In the aforementioned example of the button text changing when clicked, the code for that being within a function allows it to only change the button text when the button is clicked, and not in any other circumstances.</p>
