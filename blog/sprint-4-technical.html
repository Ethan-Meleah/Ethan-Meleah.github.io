          <h3> Reflect on a time when you got blocked on a simple problem. </h3>
          <p> Back when I was working on my diploma I was building a mobile app, where you could comment on posts. I couldn’t tie the comments to the post, and I struggled with this for a long time. In the end, I had made an error working with the way that the pages were linked. Which I figured out… after I rebuilt the entire app from the start. I felt frustrated, and I really learnt the importance of planning everything out in detail. </p>

          <h3>Reflect on a time where you solved a problem elegantly. </h3>
          <p>There was a time when I was creating the walking animation for a game similar to pokemon. I had to make the character move when they walk. However, it would always look like the character was walking left, no matter the direction. To solve this, I would go through each step of the code and add messages that would let me know when I reached each step. This allowed me to identify where the code was going wrong, and fix the errors found there. When a step came up with an error it allowed me to identify where something was wrong quickly and efficiently. I learnt the usefulness of Console.Logging and how to identify where exactly the problem is.</p>

         <h2>Reflection on Problem Solving Techniques</h2>

         <h3>Pseuocode</h3>
         <p>I am familiar and confident at using Pseudocode in order to plan out individual functions. I really don’t plan as often as I should when I’m building something- and sometimes I get frustrated when my Pseudocode doesn’t pan out compared to how the code actually needs to be ordered. It's a useful planning tool that I don't use often enough.</p>

         <h3>Rubber Ducky Method</h3>
         <p>A long time ago I learnt that the best way to learn something is to teach something. Because of this, I’ve always tried to go through my code line by line with my peers. I had never done it to a rubber duck or stuffed animal, but in practice the results are similar. I personally enjoy using this method, and find it very helpful. </p>

         <h3>Reading Error Messages</h3>
         <p>Reading error messages is another technique that really helps locate and identify a location. It’s something I have used a lot in the past, and also an excellent technique to understand how to fix the error. I feel as confident doing this, it’s something that I have used to help me many times before, and will continue to do so.</p>

         <h3>Console.Logging</h3>
         <p>Console.Logging is a great practical way to go through your code, section by section. I find it best for identifying problems in the control flow, and making sure your code is going through the flow exactly as it should- or more accurately, showing where it isn’t.</p>

         <h3>Googling</h3>
         <p>Ah googling. Most of the time, it leads you to Stack Exchange, the holy grail of coders everywhere. This is one of the most important skills in my repertoire, and is what I consider to be my old reliable. When everything else fails, googling rarely does. It isn’t as simple as copy pasting the answer, as most of the time you have to ensure that you understand the material. Your coding solution is different to everyone on the internet, and if you don’t understand what you find googling you won’t be able to modify it if you need to later.</p>

         <h3>Asking your peers for help.</h3>
         <p>I am capable of asking my peers for help, but I generally tend to choose this as a last resort option. While I prefer working out my problems on my own, when I have to I can reach out to my peers whom I have spoken too. This is an area where I need to become more comfortable in- and I’m hoping to get the opportunity to do so in bootcamp.</p>

         <h3>Asking your coaches for help.</h3>
         <p>This is the area I struggle with the most, by far. I have done work with code before, which has made most of the projects I have done during foundations revision for me- which hasn’t put me in a position that needs help. But I definitely understand the need to be able to do this, and understand that I won’t be able to keep this up when we enter boot camp. This is the biggest area I need to improve.</p>

         <h3>Improve your process with reflection.</h3>
         <p>Reflection is the thing that I have learned the most about during my time here at DevAcademy. While it was a requirement in my previous study, I never took the time to understand <span class="italics"> why </span> I was reflecting, and it felt like busy work. But now I am happy to say that reflection is something that has clicked for me, and I have had insights into my learning while reflecting. I am much more confident reflecting. </p>
